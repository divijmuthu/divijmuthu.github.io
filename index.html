        <h2>Analysis and Implementation of Machine Learning Approaches to Identifying DDoS & Benign Network Traffic</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Guided by a Georgia Tech Postdoc, published in UCIxGATI Science Journal: <a href="https://scienceyouth.org/web/viewer.php?id=175">Link here!</a></li>
            <li>Studied various machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM; implemented these models to identify hostile network traffic using the CICDDoS2019 dataset, a common industry benchmark for testing</li>
            <li>Compared and contrasted pros and cons of these models; provided recommendations for future machine learning approaches to isolating and throttling traffic associated with a DDoS attack</li>
